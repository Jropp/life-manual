# Managing Tasks with Trello

https://youtu.be/Wqj38FAIPAs

Trello is where we will manage tasks. Your work session should start and end looking at this trello board, in particular the "In Progress" column will tell me what you are looking on. 

While I won't look at this board frequently (maybe once or twice a week) please keep it updated the best you can. Most important is that your "In Progress" column us up to date at the beginning and end of your work session.

## Creating A Card

- Each task should be represented as a card on the board.
- If a task is complex, add a checklist within the card.
- Alternatively, break it into multiple smaller cards.
- Assign a priority label to each card (e.g., "High", "Medium", "Low").

## Columns

### Later on

Pretty obvious, but for things that aren't going to happen for a while.

### ToDo:

Things that are ready for action

### In Progress:

Things you are working on. THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT COLUMN. If you don't want me to ask a bunch about what you are working on, keep this up to date. And if I forget and ask you what you are working on you can just send me a link to the trello board and I'll look at the in progress column.

### Blocked/Questions:

If something in progress is stalled out because you are lacking information or waiting on someone else.

## Interacting With Jason

I will look at the trello board sometimes and maybe add some cards into ToDo or Later on. But I won't be watching it closely. If you have a question about a particular card, you can ask it in the card and then send me a message that you need my follow up on something. If I haven't responded in the card by the third day, send me a reminder.
