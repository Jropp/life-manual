## Why This? Why Me?

If you are reading this, I feel sorry for you. Though obviously I'm not *that* sorry, otherwise you wouldn't be reading this.

But to spare you further pain, let's get to brass tacks. 

This manual is a collection of my life and all the little automations that make it up, automations that you will be running. It is a living document, at least as long as I am still alive, and so it will change and you should note parts that could use some sprucing up, or additional info. I am not good at taking care of the details, this is my attempt to do so. 

You should always feel free to ask me questions, though do try to read and find the answer at least for a little bit. The goal is to at least create a buffer between me and as many little details as possible, but there will be things I haven't explained well enough, or things that are just flat out wrong. So don't get stuck for too long, but do make sure it's a good time in my circadian rhythm (I'll explain later) to reach out.
