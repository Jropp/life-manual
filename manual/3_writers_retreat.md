# Writer's Retreat

## The Hills Are Alive (With Banjo Playing)

Each year I host a writer's retreat in Clayhole, Kentucky. It's a small informal retreat, but we are looking to grow the size of the group from 8-12 up to about 20. We have a sense that it's time to transition from improving our own work to helping the next generation get going with theirs. 

## Bethel Camp

As it currently stands, we've had an informal agreement with Bethel Camp. Attendees pay the camp, and we have a running ledger with them.

Currently expenses are tracked in our [ledger](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1M8axZAh8wQwwjcA2s_n1GHVmJ1Ln0-SLTNitrxxbhPY/edit?gid=1091776946#gid=1091776946). This is just a running balance of our expense and income so that on years we have excess we can do something fun like sponsor a writer or pay for a speaker.

## Tasks

In an attempt to just keep things very simple, the bethelwritersretreat@gmail.com calendar will have time based tasks.

## Communications

### Facebook

There is a facebook account called Bethel Writer's Retreat, which is a shell account because I don't want to have a facebook account. That user manages the Bethel Writer's Network which is where we have primarily done our communications.

### Mailchimp

The core of communications will be our email list. Announcements and such should be distributed primarily through our mailchimp account.
